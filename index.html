            <h1>Simple Present</h1>
            <p>The Simple Present is the verb tense used in everyday life, corresponding to the present tense in Portuguese. In English, the conjugation of verbs differs from the mother tongue, using the base form of the verb in affirmative sentences and the auxiliary verb "do" in negative and interrogative sentences. This structure does not involve conjugation for all people, unlike Portuguese.</p>
            <p><b>When to use Simple Present?</b></p>
            <p>The Simple Present is used in everyday contexts to describe truths, facts, physical characteristics or emotional states, tell stories, quantify the frequency of actions and describe routines and habits. Its use is comprehensive and encompasses various everyday situations.</p>
            <p>Note the following examples:</p>
            <div id="exemplo">
                <p> - Peter has breakfast at work. Peter toma café no trabalho. <b>(hábito, rotina)</b></p>
                <p> - The Earth turns around the sun. A terra gira em torno do sol. <b>(fato, verdade)</b></p>
                <p> - My parents aren’t very tall. Meus pais não são muito altos. <b>(aspecto físico)</b></p>
                <p> - She seems happy today. Ela parece feliz hoje. <b>(estado emocional)</b></p>

                            <p>In the English language, the auxiliary verb in the simple present do indicates that a sentence can be either negative or interrogative. Therefore, when making a negation, the main verb must be preceded by do + not or does + not. In this case, for the third person singular, does is already inflected, therefore, the main verb remains in its base form and without the particle to.

                                Furthermore, you can use the contracted form of the auxiliary: don’t or doesn’t, especially in more informal texts.</p>

                            <p>In questions, we also use the auxiliary do. The structure of a question in the English language differs from our mother tongue, because the verb (auxiliary) comes at the beginning of the sentence, in addition to the punctuation (?)</p>

                            <p>1951: Fred Terman establishes Stanford Research Park as a partnership between Stanford University and the City of
                                Palo Alto, providing a base of operations for both military and commercial technological innovations for companies
                                such as Hewlett Packard, Lockheed, and Xerox.</p>
                            <p>1955: William Shockley opens his own firm, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, in Mountain View. Several
                                Shockley employees resign and start a competing firm, Fairchild Semiconductor. Fairchild employees will later
                                go on to start many other companies, including Intel and AMD.</p>
                            <p>1958 to 1960: Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby independently discover that all parts of a circuit, including
                                the transistor, can be created using silicon. Their discoveries lead to the integrated circuit, created
                                from silicon, used in all microprocessors today.
                                </p>
